Blender is a very powerful tool to manipulate the virtual world of film and videos. It excels in the field of VFX whereas the field of SFX and the manipulation of the physical set is left to proprietary solutions.
Having such a solution designed, built, gotten the TÃœV approval, it has been used on a number of A-movies. I would now like to invoke the Open Source approach that has Blender thriving, hoping other users are going to be as fascinated as I am myself in getting Blender to interact with the power SFX (MOCO) Stunts and Shows need.



## Installation:
Download Blender add-on from: https://github.com/wiredworks/wiredworks_winches
After getting the .zip remove '-master' from the filename and unzip it to the Blender scripts/add-ons folder. Take the modified Node Editor (/UClients_and_helpers/space-node.py and overwrite the standard Node Editor (/Programs/Blender Foundation/Blender 2.83/2.83/scripts/startup/bl_ui/space_node.py). Start Blender and activate the addon (Blender-> Edit-> Preferences-> Add-ons).
